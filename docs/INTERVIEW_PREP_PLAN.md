# Full Stack Developer Interview Preparation Plan

## Technology Stack Overview
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript, Remix (SSR Framework)
- **Backend**: Node.js + tRPC (Type-safe API)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM (Type-safe queries)
- **Key Concepts**: SSR, Type Safety, Modern Full Stack Architecture

## Interview Preparation Project: "Task Management App"

### Project Features to Implement:
1. **User Authentication** (Login/Register)
2. **Task CRUD Operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
3. **Real-time Updates** (Optional: WebSockets)
4. **Server-Side Rendering** (Remix)
5. **Type-Safe API Calls** (tRPC)
6. **Database Relations** (Users, Tasks, Categories)

## Key Interview Topics & Practice Areas

### 1. Remix Framework Concepts
- **File-based routing** vs Angular routing
- **Loaders and Actions** (SSR data fetching)
- **Form handling** with progressive enhancement
- **Error boundaries** and error handling
- **Meta tags** and SEO optimization

### 2. tRPC Type Safety
- **Router definition** with input/output validation
- **Client-side usage** with React Query
- **Error handling** and middleware
- **Type inference** across client/server boundary

### 3. Drizzle ORM Features
- **Schema definition** with TypeScript
- **Relations** and joins
- **Migrations** and database setup
- **Query building** vs traditional SQL

### 4. React + TypeScript Best Practices
- **Component patterns** (since you know React basics)
- **Custom hooks** for state management
- **Form handling** with validation
- **Error boundaries** and loading states

## Practice Exercises by Difficulty

### Beginner Level (Day 1-2)
1. Setup project with all technologies
2. Create basic Remix routes
3. Setup tRPC router with simple queries
4. Connect to PostgreSQL with Drizzle

### Intermediate Level (Day 3-4)
1. Implement user authentication flow
2. Create CRUD operations for tasks
3. Add form validation and error handling
4. Implement server-side data loading

### Advanced Level (Day 5-7)
1. Add real-time features
2. Implement optimistic updates
3. Add advanced filtering and pagination
4. Performance optimization techniques

## Common Interview Questions to Prepare

### Technical Questions:
1. "Explain the difference between Remix loaders and React useEffect for data fetching"
2. "How does tRPC ensure type safety across client and server?"
3. "What are the benefits of Drizzle ORM over traditional ORMs?"
4. "How would you handle form validation in Remix?"
5. "Explain SSR vs CSR and when to use each"

### Coding Challenges:
1. "Build a real-time notification system"
2. "Implement optimistic UI updates for better UX"
3. "Create a search feature with debouncing"
4. "Add pagination to a large dataset"
5. "Implement role-based access control"

### Architecture Questions:
1. "How would you structure a large Remix application?"
2. "Explain your approach to error handling across the stack"
3. "How would you implement caching strategies?"
4. "Describe your testing strategy for this stack"
