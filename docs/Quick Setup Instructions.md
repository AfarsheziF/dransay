## Key Interview Topics to Master

1. **Type Safety**: How TypeScript flows through Remix → tRPC → Database
2. **SSR Benefits**: Why server-side rendering matters for UX and SEO
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Forms that work without JavaScript
4. **Performance**: Database optimization, caching, loading states
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user experience
6. **Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E testing strategies

## Common Gotchas

1. **Don't just implement - explain WHY** you chose each approach
2. **Ask clarifying questions** - shows you think before coding
3. **Consider edge cases** - what happens when things go wrong?
4. **Think about scale** - how does this work with 10x more users?
5. **User experience first** - technical decisions should serve users

Good luck! Remember, they want to see how you think and solve problems, not just if you can memorize syntax.
