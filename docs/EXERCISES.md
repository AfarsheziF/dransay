# Interview Preparation Exercises

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install

Make sure PostgreSQL is running, then:
```bash
# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your database credentials
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/interview_prep_db"

# Create database (if it doesn't exist)
createdb interview_prep_db

# Generate and run migrations
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate

# Seed database with sample data
npm run db:seed
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Angular vs Remix: Key Differences to Highlight

### Data Fetching:
- **Angular**: Services with HttpClient, RxJS observables
- **Remix**: Loaders for SSR, tRPC for mutations

### Routing:
- **Angular**: Programmatic routing with Router service
- **Remix**: File-based routing, nested routes

### Form Handling:
- **Angular**: Reactive Forms with FormBuilder
- **Remix**: Progressive enhancement with Form component

### State Management:
- **Angular**: Services, NgRx for complex state
- **Remix**: Server state via loaders, tRPC for mutations

## Common Gotchas & Interview Tips

1. **Remember to explain the "why"**: Don't just implement, explain the benefits of each technology choice

2. **Type Safety**: Always emphasize how TypeScript flows through the entire stack

3. **Performance**: Mention SSR benefits, but also understand when CSR might be better

4. **User Experience**: Consider loading states, optimistic updates, error handling

5. **Scalability**: Think about how your solutions would work with 10x the data

## Mock Interview Script

**Interviewer**: "Walk me through how you would add a new feature - let's say task comments - to this application"

**Expected Answer Structure**:
1. Database schema changes (Drizzle)
2. tRPC procedures for comments
3. UI components with proper loading states
4. Form handling in Remix
5. Type safety considerations
6. Testing approach
